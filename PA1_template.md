## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

date_wise <- group_by(repdata, date)

#calculating the total number of steps per day
steps_by_day <- summarise(date_wise, total = sum(steps))
steps_by_day
```

     xlab="Total number of steps in a day")
```

##  2012-10-03: 1   1st Qu.: 8841

##  2012-10-07: 1   Max.   :21194

```
Mean & Median of total number of steps per day are 10766 and 10765 respectively.


## What is the average daily activity pattern?


```r
# aggregating the data by interval
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, repdata, mean)

# create a time series plot 
plot(steps_by_interval$interval, steps_by_interval$steps, type='l', 
     main="Average number of steps over all days", xlab="Interval", 
     ylab="Average number of steps")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](figure/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

```r
# find row with max of steps
max_steps_row <- which.max(steps_by_interval$steps)

# find interval with this max
steps_by_interval[max_steps_row, ]
```

```
##     interval    steps
## 104      835 206.1698
```
The interval 835 has the maximum average number of steps which is 206.1698


## Imputing missing values


```r
# Using the mean for that 5-minute interval where the value is missing for imputing the variable

data_imputed <- repdata1
for (i in 1:nrow(data_imputed)) {
  if (is.na(data_imputed$steps[i])) {
    interval_value <- data_imputed$interval[i]
    steps_value <- steps_by_interval[
      steps_by_interval$interval == interval_value,]
    data_imputed$steps[i] <- steps_value$steps
  }
}
```
The new data set repdata_impute which equals to repdata but without NA’s. All NA’s are replaced with the mean for that 5-minute interval where the value is missing.



# calculate  total number of steps taken each day and plotting the histogram again


```r
df_imputed_steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data_imputed, sum)
head(df_imputed_steps_by_day)
```

```
##         date    steps
## 1 2012-10-01 10766.19
## 2 2012-10-02   126.00
## 3 2012-10-03 11352.00
## 4 2012-10-04 12116.00
## 5 2012-10-05 13294.00
## 6 2012-10-06 15420.00
```

```r
hist(df_imputed_steps_by_day$steps, main="Histogram of total number of steps per day (imputed)", 
     xlab="Total number of steps in a day")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7](figure/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

```r
# get mean and median of imputed data
mean(df_imputed_steps_by_day$steps)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

```r
median(df_imputed_steps_by_day$steps)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

```r
# get mean and median of data without NA's
mean(steps_by_day$total)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

```r
median(steps_by_day$total)
```

```
## [1] 10765
```

Mean values stays the same but therer is slight difference in meadian value.


# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


```r
data_imputed['type_of_day'] <- weekdays(as.Date(data_imputed$date))
data_imputed$type_of_day[data_imputed$type_of_day  %in% c('Saturday','Sunday') ] <- "weekend"
data_imputed$type_of_day[data_imputed$type_of_day != "weekend"] <- "weekday"

# convert type_of_day from character to factor
data_imputed$type_of_day <- as.factor(data_imputed$type_of_day)

# calculate average steps by interval across all days
df_imputed_steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + type_of_day, data_imputed, mean)

# creat a plot
qplot(interval, 
      steps, 
      data = df_imputed_steps_by_interval, 
      type = 'l', 
      geom=c("line"),
      xlab = "Interval", 
      ylab = "Number of steps", 
      main = "") +
  facet_wrap(~ type_of_day, ncol = 1)
```

```
